![Banner](https://github.com/ehoogeboom/multinomial_diffusion/blob/main/images/overview_mult_diff.png?raw=true)

In the folder containing `setup.py`, run
```
pip install --user -e .
```
The `--user` option ensures the library will only be installed for your user.
The `-e` option makes it possible to modify the library, and modifications will be loaded on the fly.

You should now be able to use it.


# Running experiments.

Go to the experiment of interest (folder segmentation_diffusion or text_diffusion) and follow the readme instructions there.
